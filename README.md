Here is my open World Game, 
I only had around 15h for this exercise thats why it still contains some bugs. 
The goal was only to create a 3D World, where you can run around interact a little bit with your surrounding.

With the right click you can throw balls and with the left click you can set certain boxes similar to minecraft. 
With F you can turn on the flashlight for when the sunsets (when pressing Q).
